WALMART SALES FORECASTING DATA SET :

INTRODUCTION:

2.train.csv and test.csv provides the information on historical sales of data of 45 stores of Walmart,features.csv,stores.csv, each of which having various departments. The goal is to predict the department-wise sales of each store using the historical data spanning across 143 weeks.


3.Walmart is also known for conducting promotional markdown events before major holidays such as Christmas, Thanksgiving, and Super Bowl among others. The difference between the weightage given to the data of regular weeks and the weeks including holiday seasons, coupled with unavailability of complete historical data, adds another level of difficulty of factoring the effects of the markdowns on the sales during the holiday weeks. 

4.It is a regression analysis problem.
